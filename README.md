# [Breast Cancer Prediction: Project Overview](https://github.com/MunirYousef/Breast_Cancer_Predictor/blob/gh-pages/Breast_Cancer_Predictor.ipynb)
The information presented in this file contains data representing the correlation between characteristics or features of cells in Malignant and Benign masses. Some of the features include "uniformity of cell shape" and "clump thickness". 
After plotting the data in pairplots and heatmaps to visualize our values, the data was then split into a training and testing group using sklearn and preprocessing methods. 
The data was then fit into various ML algorithms/classifiers to test the models accuracy. The results of each test were displayed in a confusion matrix and visualizers. 
######## These operations were performed using Python in Jupyter Notebook with the only requirement being the imported libraries and the breast cancer data set which is also available on kaggle.

Project tools used:
-	Numpy
-	Pandas
-	matplotlib.pyplot
-	seaborn

# [Global Temperature Prediction: Project Overview](https://github.com/MunirYousef/Global_Temp/blob/master/Global_Temp_TS.ipynb)
This project was created to predict the trend of rising global temperatures using an ARIMA time series model. 
The procedure requires importing the necessesary tools for analysis and visualization. 
The dataset was pulled from https://datahub.io/core/global-temp and preprocessed to only include the temperatures recorded in March, every year from 1895 to 2016.

# [ArcGIS Analysis Of Mining Communities In The United States In Relation To Average Household Income And Education Level: Project Overview](https://github.com/MunirYousef/ArcGIS/blob/master/yousef-%20ArcGIS%20Final%20Part3.docx)

In most cases in within the United States, mining camps came first, and communities built up around them. These communities have a number of different aspects that can be analyzed along demographic lines to better understand how earning potential in households are impacted by the presence of mining operations. This too can take many forms including educational achievement, etc.  While all of these are important to analyze together, this study focused average household income in mining communities by County.  

To better understand the communities that mining camps are situated in, demographic data on the attainment of average income by county was analyzed.  Since this may be both a national and localized phenomenon, the analysis included both a national perspective and a local one.  Westchester County in New York State was used for local analysis. The study was conducted to determine:
1.	What is the distribution of average income in mining towns in the continental United States and locally in Westchester County?
2.	What is the distribution of counties with average income (both locally and nationally)?
3.	What mining towns are in the designated demographic (Average income with Bachelor’s degrees attained less than the Mean)?

**Methodology**
The development environment for this study was ESRI ArcGIS Arcmap.
This study used data from Social Explorer’s Education data set. Social Explorer has a wide variety of demographic data sets including:
1.	Education
2.	Employment
3.	Family
4.	Housing
5.	Income
6.	Poverty
7.	Real Estate
