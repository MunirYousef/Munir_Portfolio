# [Project 1: Breast Cancer Prediction: Project Overview](https://github.com/MunirYousef/Breast_Cancer_Predictor/blob/gh-pages/Breast_Cancer_Predictor.ipynb)
The information presented in this file contains data representing the correlation between characteristics or features of cells in Malignant and Benign masses. Some of the features include "uniformity of cell shape" and "clump thickness". 
After plotting the data in pairplots and heatmaps to visualize our values, the data was then split into a training and testing group using sklearn and preprocessing methods. 
The data was then fit into various ML algorithms/classifiers to test the models accuracy. The results of each test were displayed in a confusion matrix and visualizers. ######## These operations were performed using Python in Jupyter Notebook with the only requirement being the imported libraries and the breast cancer data set which is also available on kaggle.
Project tools used:
•	Numpy
•	Pandas
•	matplotlib.pyplot
•	seaborn

# [Project 2: Global Temperature Prediction: Project Overview](https://github.com/MunirYousef/Global_Temp/blob/master/Global_Temp_TS.ipynb)
This project was created to predict the trend of rising global temperatures using an ARIMA (AutoRegression, Integration, Moving Average) time series model. 
The steps follow a simple procedure of importing the necessesary tools for analysis and visualization. 
The dataset was pulled from https://datahub.io/core/global-temp and preprocessed to only include the temperatures recorded in March, every year from 1895 to 2016.

# [Project 3: Time Series Analysis: Project Overview](https://github.com/MunirYousef/Time_Series_Prediction/blob/master/TimeSeriesForecast.ipynb)
This analysis will attempt to predict the future price of gold using the historical fluctuating values of gold, oil and the dollar.
The data ranging from November 24th 2006 to March 4th 2020, consisting of 4851 rows of data, pulled and compiled from Investing.com
