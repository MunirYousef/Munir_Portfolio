# Project 1: This project was created to predict the trend of rising global temperatures using an ARIMA (AutoRegression, Integration, Moving Average) time series model. 
# The steps follow a simple procedure of importing the necessesary tools for analysis and visualization. 
# The dataset was pulled from https://datahub.io/core/global-temp and preprocessed to only include the temperatures recorded in March, every year from 1895 to 2016.
